    "# Python for Solar Physicists\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick(ish) guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org) is the language of choice for many researchers, and is actively developed and maintained. Best of all, the open-source community has adopted this for many open science analysis packages. Even better, there’s no license manager to deal with!\n",
    "\n",
    "Many folks will recommend installing a version of python bundled with other python packages geared at scientific analysis (Anaconda, etc). I enjoy having a bit more control over which packages are installed, and how I go about updating these. I’ve also never met a software wizard I trust. How easy is it to install python with homebrew?\n",
    "\n",
    "    brew install python\n",
    "\n",
    "Done. Almost like magic.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of additional packages that make scientific analysis and presentation much easier on the python platform. For that, we’ll need the `pip3` or `pip` tool, depending on which version of python was installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) allows for more advanced array handling within python.\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip3 install numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org) contains a variety of mathematics, science, and engineering packages for signal analysis, processing, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip3 install scipy\n",
    "\n",
    "[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) provides a beautiful set of data visualization tools for use within python. Syntax and appearance mimics that in Matlab, which can make the transition a bit easier for some folks seeing the light. A [gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) has more examples than you have time to explore. The palettable package provides more extensive color table management, as well as a library of Wes Anderson film-inspired color palettes... because of course that exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip3 install matplotlib\n",
    "    pip3 install palettable\n",
    "\n",
    "[iPython](http://ipython.org) is an interactive command line interface for python, again making it more akin to a Matlab-like-environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip3 install ipython\n",
    "\n",
    "A few other packages will enable some astronomy libraries, as well as tools for dealing with reading large databases. Many packages will eventually call for these as pre-requisites, so I’d go ahead and install these now.\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip3 install astropy\n",
    "    pip3 install pandas\n",
    "    pip3 install h5py\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, but certainly not least, we can install the [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) package, which aims to replace many of the standard solar software routines. In particular, providing a free and open replacement for the SolarSoft packages is of key interest. While SolarSoft itself is a great resource, the reliance on IDL licensing is less than ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip3 install sunpy\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing SunPy itself should pick up any additional required packages - in fact you could even skip most of the individual component installs, and just start with SunPy... but hardly any fun. And with that, you now have a fully functional solar physics battlestation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Updating\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've got a nice stable installation setup and running, what better than to upgrade packages to break existing code and workflows. For the brave (or for those with virtual environments setup) all packages can be upgraded with pip in one (two) fell swoop(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip3 freeze --local | grep -v '^\\-e' | cut -d = -f 1  | xargs -n1 pip3 install -U\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Virtual environments\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing this core set of packages, you might run into a bit of code that requires something more obscure. Rather than polluting this main tree of package installation, virtual environments allow a user to install required packages locally, in the project working directory. This will then allow either more obscure packages, or older versions that cannot be upgraded without breaking some code. First, the env directory must be created, and then sourced before use to modify the python path prior to package installation and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "    python -m venv /path/to/new/directory\n",
    "    source /path/to/new/directory/bin/activate\n",
    "    \n",
    "## (Optional) matplotlibrc configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the choices in the default matplotlibrc configuration file don't mesh with my style of working and generating plots. I'd recommend searching and *correcting* (or just modifying) the following lines if they haven't been changed by default:\n",
    "\n",
    "    backend          : MacOSX\n",
    "    figure.figsize   : 5, 5     ## figure size in inches\n",
    "    figure.dpi       : 300      ## figure dots per inch\n",
    "    image.cmap       : magma    ## A colormap name, gray etc...\n",
    "    image.origin     : lower    ## lower | upper\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "You can also utilize TeX rendering for figure labels and other text elements by invoking:\n",
    "\n",
    "    font.serif          : Computer Modern Roman, Bitstream Vera Serif, New Century Schoolbook, Century Schoolbook L, Utopia, ITC Bookman, Bookman, Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, Times, Palatino, Charter, serif\n",
    "    text.usetex         : True\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "    ipython --pylab\n",
    "    \n",
    "This is where the fun begins."
